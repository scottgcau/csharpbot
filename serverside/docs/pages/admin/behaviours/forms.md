# Forms Behaviour

The Forms behaviour allows product owners to build and manage forms to capture information. This functionality has many applications and use cases, some examples being: surveys, questionnaires, sign-up forms, or application forms.

There are many question types which are available for use out of the box, though developers can also create custom question types if required.

The Forms behaviour would not be suitable for:

* Creating structured data
* Managing data
* Account log in
* Account registration
